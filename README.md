## Modules
Some scripts will be released as seperated modules. These modules are located inside the modules dir.

## Configs
All configs are located in the configs dir. Config variables are inside the namespace Config and a class for a specific part of the config e.g. Config\Hosting::baseUrl.

## Pages
We load the content of a page between the <body> and <footer> tag. Make sure you do not use uninitialized vars.

## Content (wrong name)
The content dir holds basic script parts e.g. footer, header and errors.
